## Car Time
library(viridis)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
```

```{r}
cars <- read.csv("/Users/nick/Desktop/DataViz/Assigenment 2/cars-sample.csv")

## Lets make the replica graph
cars %>%  ggplot(aes(x = Weight, y = MPG, size = Weight, color = Manufacturer)) +
  geom_point(alpha=0.5) 

```

```{r}
## lets do it again but make it color blind friendly this time
cars %>%  ggplot(aes(x = Weight, y = MPG, size = Weight, color = Manufacturer)) +
  geom_point(alpha=0.5) + scale_color_viridis(discrete = TRUE, option = "turbo")

```

```{r}
## Lets see them all individually too
cars %>%  ggplot(aes(x = Weight, y = MPG, size = Weight, color = Manufacturer)) +
  geom_point(alpha=0.5) + scale_color_viridis(discrete = TRUE, option = "turbo") + facet_wrap( ~ Manufacturer)
