# The instruction about the interactive functions

### Mouse move over a bubble:
  The bubble will turn into red and the size will become bigger. 
  This function is used to make the select bubble more clear compared with other bubbles, 
  since some of the bubbles are overlapped together and hard to distinguish.
### Mouse move away from one bubble: 
  The bubble will return to the original color and size.
### Click on the bubble: 
  The bubble will move to the top of the chart. 
  This function is used to remove the unsignificant data, inorder to make the significant data much easier to observe and compare.
### Press on the bubble which are removed on the previous step: 
  The bubble can be dragged down to the original position.
  But pay attention to the following things: 
  When you drag the bubble down, you should keep your mouse inside the bubble all the time, 
  otherwise, the bubble will stop going down. 
  When you dragged the bubble back to the original position, 
  you should first move your mouse outside of the bubble, then stop pressing down the mouse, 
  otherwise, the bubble will move to the top again.
