#### R + ggplot2
The combination of R and ggplot2 has the best expirience in plotting. The ggplot2 is easy to use and generate beautiful colors for different types of data. Simply use geom-point() and apply color based on manufacturer and you are done.

#### Excel
The difficulty I faced in excel is that I can't find a way to have two legends in one chart, and excel doesn't seems to have thn function to show the legend of the size of certain data. Also, it's hard to set the range of axis automatically. The only two choices for changing axis range is either accept it can only start from zero or change it manually.

#### d3.js
The problem I faced is that fetch() doesn't allowed to read local file in the computer so I upload the csv file to my repository and use fetch() to get the data from address github provided. After that just put a svg layer as base and put axis and label and so on. It quite tricky comparing to other tools like ggplot2, but it allow user to intereact with the plot if possible.

#### Python + matplotlib
I imported panda to import and parse the csv file and use functions from matplotlib to give data to make scatter plot. I also used dictionary to go through manufacturer to apply different colors. This

#### Flourish
I am shocked how easy to make simple scatterplot online. You only need to import the data and choose the plot types and it will do the rest for you. User can have simple changes based on user's preferences. The whole process took less than five minute.




### Technical Achievement Description:
Used dictionary to have a delicate way to apply different colors for different manufacturer. Avoided unneccsary for loop. Other than that just normal process to make a graph without fancy tricks.
### Design Achievement Description:
I applied minimalism to all the choice of colors and font to make the graph easy to read and beautiful.
