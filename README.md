Assignment 2 - Data Visualization, 5 Ways  
===

I used 5 ways of visualizations. For 3 out of 5 ways of visualizations, I used programming languages with different packages. 
1. Python + Seaborn

Seaborn is a Python data visualization library. I used it to draw scatterplot with semi-transparent dots, and the size of the dots are adjusted to the weight of the input variable.  

2. R + ggplot2

ggplot2 allows to build almost any type of chart. Here I used it to build the semi-transparent scatterplot, with customized colors for each manufacturer. 

3. Javascript + D3

D3.js is a JavaScript library for manipulating documents based on data. It provides powerful visualization components and a data-driven approach to DOM manipulation.
Here I used D3 library to construct the semi-transparent scatterplot with customized colors, and the size of the dots are scaled to the weight of the input variable.

4. Flourish

Flourish is a user-friendly data visualization tool. Itâ€™s easy to navigate for users. I just need to upload the dataset and choose the features for input, output and color choices to generate the scatterplot. 

5. Tableau Desktop

Tableau Desktop is a widely used data visualization software that is easy to navigate for users. I just need to upload the dataset and choose the features for input, output and color choices to generate the scatterplot.
