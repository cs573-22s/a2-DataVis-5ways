# R + ggplot2 

R is a language primarily focused on statistical computing.
ggplot2 is a popular library for charting in R.
R Markdown is a document format that compiles to HTML or PDF and allows you to include the output of R code directly in the document.

While it takes time to find the correct documentation, these functions made the effort creating this chart minimal.

# d3
D3 is a javascript library used for adding designs, creating plots and animating webpages trough html. I think this one was the most complex graph out of all of them, and it requiered the most lines of code. 

# Python + plotly
This python library provides the necesary tools for creating graphs in a few lines of code, but i found that is not very versatile and it those not allow you to change the structure of the graphs much, that is why I was not able to add the legen for the dot sizes.

# Tableau 
Tableu is very versatile and it allows you to make very complex graphs. the only difficulty is that it contatins lots of functionality which can be a little bit overewhelming.

# Flourish
Flourish is a free grpahing tool, I think it was a little hard, and I was not able to add the weight legend as well. Flourish has a nice way of adding your graphs to your website using html tags, and they update if you change it on the flourish platform.

## Technical Achievements
- Was able to create the graphs in 3 coding languages and libraries.
- Used two non coding platforms to create two graphs 

### Design Achievements
- Used differnt colors and opacities on the graphs
