Assignment 2 - Data Visualization, 5 Ways  
===

What was easy? Difficult? Where could you see the tool being useful in the future? Did you have to use any hacks or data manipulation to get the right chart?

# matplotlib - python
![matplotlib](img/matplotlib_img(python).png)
Using matplotlib was relatively easy because i have used it in the past for other coding classes. The combination of matplotlib, seaborn, and pandas is something I  was using last semester. I feel like my familiarity with this tool is partly why i can see this being more useful in the future. Getting the right chart for this method/library was straightforwat aside from needing to add in the tick intervals, which is something I had not needed to do before.


# plotly - python
![plotly](img/plotly_img(python).png)
Plotly was a library that I had been introduced to recently and in using it, I think that it is one of the more user friendly libraries. I found it pretty easy to figure out in a short period of time. I also has some fun playing with the chart aesthetics and features before decding on the final image. 

# plotly - r
![plotly](img/plotly_img(r).png)
Again transfering plotly from python to r took some time, but it to wasnt a terrible hassle to figure out. I did need to find extra documentaion for this tranfser  between coding laguages. It took me a while to realize certain reason why I wasn't getting an output, but its an easy fix and easy to adjst too. Using the piping to update the image was the best method i could find when trying to add things to the final image. 

# ggplot - r
![ggplot2](img/ggplot2_img(r).png)
Because we did a lot of this one in class, the final image including the point sizes based on weight was not hard to do. However, figuring out how to incorperate that probably took longer than it should have for me. While coding it, I was over-complicating it and as a result, I kept getting unhelpful error messages. I thinkn I just need more work in r as it is a new language for me and I was expecting it to be more difficult than it actually was.


# d3
![caption](img/<imgname>)
This is definetly the most difficult language for me to figure out. My main focus was getting the graph rendered successfully, because if something was in the wrong order then i would end up with a black screen which was frustrating. d3 is something that takes me a long time to figure out, and even with all of the documentation that I look at, I still find it difficult to get certain things to work.I would much rather work in python as a visulaization language over d3. I can understand why people would like to use this as a method of making very complicated and interactive visualizations, but I think after this class, I am going to stick with python and r instead.

- Description of the Technical achievements you attempted with this visualization.

  - For a few of the images, hovering over the points to see some details is possible, I think I will play more with the technical interactiveness for the next assignment because I focused more on exploring and playing with the design more this time.
  
- Description of the Design achievements you attempted with this visualization.

  - During the designing of the graphs, I spent a lot of time investigating different color palettes and playing with the shapes and sizes of fonts, shapes, and graphs. I ended up using triangles instead of circles for one. At one point, I was trying to get each manufacturer to be a different shape instead of a different color, however I was unable to do that successfully.
